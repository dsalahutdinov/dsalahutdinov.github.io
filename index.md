## About myself

I am the passionate backend engineer at Amplifr (social media automation platform) with a mathematical background. I'm mostly about technical stuff, but working with numbers is also my passion (I am going to tell you about).

I live in the middle of Russia, in a small village in the Ural Mountains. I love to enjoy nature and spending time with my family of 3 kids.

As the Ruby developer, I am in OSS. I contribute as quite as a ninja, after midnight when all the children got asleep.
